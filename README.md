# llama.cpp Logging Using Python and VTune
A basic set of scripts designed to log llama.cpp's CPU core and memory usage over time using Python logging systems and Intel VTune.  
  
Output of the script is saved to a CSV file which contains the time stamp (incremented in one second increments), CPU core usage in percent, and RAM usage in GiB.
